# Best-Path-App
The purpose of this app is to determine the fastest possible route between two nodes on the network.

GIF images in the main folder represent two networks with interconnected nodes. The numbers represent the (e.g. difficulty or length) between two nodes. The ultimate goal is to find all possible routes and also to pick the shortest one. 

The algorithm uses brute-force search method that provides a reasonable and fast solution, but only works with the small data. In other words, brute-force search method is the programming style written in a way full of repetition, where programmer relies on the processing power of the computer. Due to this reason, the use of the brute-force algorithm for the big problem sizes would be highly ineffective.

Nevertheless this fact, brute-force search method is simple to implement.

The app is written in JavaScript.

It is not the cleanest looking code and there is lots of room for improvements (OOP for the whole app). The design is very basic as to focus was mainly placed on the functionality part for the moment. I will certainly try to clean up the code and redesign the app.
